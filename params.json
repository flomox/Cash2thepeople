I came up with the idea to create different type of companies that will share its revenue with the customers. My thought is to keep 10% of the winnings and give away 90% in 10.000$ packages randomly to customer-numbers.\r\n\r\n### First Project\r\n\r\nThe first project is a webapplication. You can click through video-adds and banner-adds and then click on \"win now\"\r\n\r\n### Second Project\r\n\r\nThe second project is a social network. I have alot of ideas how to shape it ! Facebook makes over 12.000.000â‚¬ just by adds. Imagine a big amount of this money being spread to the people in 10.000$ packages\r\n\r\n### Third Project\r\n\r\nThe third project is the equal to the social network but it`s a video streaming host like youtube\r\n\r\n### later projects\r\n\r\nlater projects will be something like ebay and then Markets, Carfactories and so on !",
